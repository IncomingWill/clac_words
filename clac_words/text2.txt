Cunard Line is a British cruise line based at Carnival House at Southampton, England, operated by Carnival UK and owned by Carnival Corporation & plc.
Since 2011, Cunard and its three ships have been registered in Hamilton, Bermuda.
In 1839, Samuel Cunard was awarded the first British transatlantic steamship mail contract.
The British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company were formed the next year in Glasgow.
They were formed with with shipowner Sir George Burns together with Robert Napier, the famous Scottish steamship engine designer and builder, to operate the line's four pioneer paddle steamers on the Liverpool to Halifax to Boston route. 
For most of the next 30 years, Cunard held the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic voyage. 
However, in the 1870s Cunard fell behind its rivals, the White Star Line and the Inman Line. 
To meet this competition, in 1879 the firm was reorganised as the Cunard Steamship Company, Ltd, to raise capital.
In 1902, White Star joined the American-owned International Mercantile Marine Co. 
In response, the British Government provided Cunard with substantial loans and a subsidy to build two superliners needed to retain Britain's competitive position.
